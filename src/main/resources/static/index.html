    <h1>Opencast Dummy GraphQL API</h1>
    <p>
        This webapp provides a Opencast-like dummy GraphQL API.
        This way, everyone in the community can play around with the API and get familiar with GraphQL.
    </p>
    <p>
        The actual API is available at <code>/graphql</code>.
        But to play with it, you probably want to use the included mini IDE GraphiQL, which is mounted here: <a href="/graphiql"><code>/graphiql</code></a>.
        On the right side, you can see the whole API schema.
        You can use ctrl+space to get auto-completions in the editor on the left.
        To see what the actual network requests are (spoiler: they are very simple), use your browser's dev tools.
    </p>
    <h2>Example queries (to get started):</h2>
    <p>Single event by ID:</p>
    <pre>
    query {
      eventById(id:"01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-000000000001") {
        title
        description
        duration
      }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>All events sorted and with a limit:</p>
    <pre>
    query {
      events(sortBy:DURATION limit:3) {
        edges {
          node {
            title
            description
          }
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>All events of a specific series:</p>
    <pre>
    query {
      seriesById(id:"76543210-abcd-abcd-abcd-000000000001") {
        events(sortBy:TITLE) {
          edges {
            node {
              title
              duration
              series { id }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    <h2>Note about "connections", pagination and long lists</h2>
    <p>
        Some fields in the API (e.g. <code>events</code> or <code>Series.events</code>) don't just return a simple array.
        That's because those lists can potentially become very long.
        In those cases, it's best practice to use so called "connections".
        This is a powerful pattern that allows for different ways of doing pagination.
        If you just want the whole list, just request <code>edges { node { ... } }</code>.
        The cursor and page information just helps frontends with pagination.
    </p>
    <p>
        This API right here currently does not support going to the previous page.
        But that's just because I didn't implement it.
        It's straight forward to add.
    </p>

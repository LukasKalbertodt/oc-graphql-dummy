        This webapp provides a Opencast-like dummy GraphQL API.
        This way, it's easier to play with the API and everyone in the community can get familiar with GraphQL.
    </p>
    <p>
        The actual API is available at <code>/graphql</code>.
        But to play with it, you probably want to use the included mini IDE GraphiQL, which is mounted here: <a href="/graphiql"><code>/graphiql</code></a>.
        On the right side, you can see the whole API schema.
        You can use ctrl+space to get auto-completions in the editor on the left.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example query:
    </p>
    <pre>
query {
    TODO
}
    </pre>

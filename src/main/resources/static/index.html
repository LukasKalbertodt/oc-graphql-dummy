    <h1>Opencast Dummy GraphQL API</h1>
    <p>
        This webapp provides a Opencast-like dummy GraphQL API.
        This way, everyone in the community can play around with the API and get familiar with GraphQL.
    </p>
    <p>
        The actual API is available at <code>/graphql</code>.
        But to play with it, you probably want to use the included mini IDE GraphiQL, which is mounted here: <a href="/graphiql"><code>/graphiql</code></a>.
        On the right side, you can see the whole API schema.
        You can use ctrl+space to get auto-completions in the editor on the left.
        To see what the actual network requests are (spoiler: they are very simple), use your browser's dev tools.
    </p>
    <h2>Example queries (to get started):</h2>
    <p>Single event by ID:</p>
    <pre>
query {
  eventById(id: "01234567-abcd-abcd-abcd-000000000001") {
    title
    description
    duration
  }
}
    </pre>
    <p>All events sorted and with a limit:</p>
    <pre>
query {
  events(sortBy: DURATION, limit: 3) {
    edges {
      node {
        title
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
    </pre>
    <p>All events of a specific series:</p>
    <pre>
query {
  seriesById(id:"76543210-abcd-abcd-abcd-000000000001") {
    events(sortBy: TITLE) {
      edges {
        node {
          title
          duration
          series { id }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
    </pre>

    <h2>Note about "connections", pagination and long lists</h2>
    <p>
        Some fields in the API (e.g. <code>events</code> or <code>Series.events</code>) don't just return a simple array.
        That's because those lists can potentially become very long.
        In those cases, it's best practice to use so called "connections".
        This is a powerful pattern that allows for different ways of doing pagination.
        If you just want the whole list, just request <code>edges { node { ... } }</code>.
        The cursor and page information just helps frontends with pagination.
    </p>
    <p>
        This API right here currently does not support going to the previous page.
        But that's just because I didn't implement it.
        It's straight forward to add.
    </p>

    <h2>Mutations</h2>
    <p>
        Of course, GraphQL also allows mutating the data.
        This example app includes only one such "mutation" endpoint, <code>addEvent</code>  .
        Note that all data is managed in memory, so whenever I redeploy or restart this, all changes to the data are gone.
        To try it out, use this "query":
    </p>
    <pre>
mutation example($event: EventInput) {
  addEvent(event: $event) {
    id title
  }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        And at the bottom left of the GraphiQL, click "QUERY VARIABLES" and insert this (for example):
    </p>
    <pre>
{
  "event": {
    "title": "Sintel",
    "duration": 456,
    "seriesId": "76543210-abcd-abcd-abcd-000000000002",
    "description": "Dragon and a nice outro song"
  }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        As you can see from the query, the mutation endpoint returns the newly inserted event.
        And you can, as usual, retrieve certain fields of that object.
    </p>
